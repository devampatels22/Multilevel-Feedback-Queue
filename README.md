# MultiLevel Feedback Queue

Using a text file this Program mimics the Multi Level Queue by reading the text file categorizing each tasks based of the "Name" "Task-Type" "Processing Time" "IO Number".
This project uses a custom linked list that holds value for each process and in conclusion creates a report.
